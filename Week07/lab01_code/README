1. double_value_single_file.S - Shows how to implement and call a function
   named double_value that doubles the value provided in the parameter.
   To assemble/compile and run using the provided Makefile execute:

                make double_value_single_file.run 
 
2. We can divide the above code in the following files:

   double_value_driver.S - represents the driver in assembly 
                           (calls double_value) 

   double_value.S - only has the double_value function implementation. 

   lab_support.S - has support functions (e.g., pint) 

   To create an executable we need to assemble/compile the above
   files along with serial.c. To assemble/compile and run using the provided 
   Makefile execute:

                  make double_value_driver.run
   
3. The assembly double_value function can be called from a C
   program.  This is illustrated by the c_prog_calling_double_value.c
   We will need to assemble/compile the files c_prog_calling_double_value.c,
   double_value.S and serial.c.  To assemble/compile using the
   provided Makefile execute:

                make c_prog_calling_double_value_s  

   To run execute:

                make c_prog_calling_double_value_s.run  

   IMPORTANT: the target name ends with _s (make c_prog_calling_double_value 
   is not correct).  We want to use the _s convention you will see
   in the assembly project.

4. make clean - removes executables

5. make - builds all executables
